# WeatherPhoto
PhotoWeather App
        A “Weather” application lets users take a photo, add current weather information (e.g. place name, temperature,  weather condition, …)
        as a banner overlay on top of the photo, and finally, share it on Facebook or Twitter 
        (No need to share text content since all information is in photo).
 
using free weather data provider  (OpenWeatherMap API)
WeatherPhotos should be saved automatically in history list where the user can get back and see any photo as a thumbnail and full size.
